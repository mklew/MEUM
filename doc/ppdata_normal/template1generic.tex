%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2010exp} on the
benchmark functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2010fun} are presented
in Figures~\ref{fig:RLDs05Da\algfolder}, \ref{fig:RLDs05Db\algfolder},
\ref{fig:RLDs20Db\algfolder},
\ref{fig:ERTloglossa\algfolder}, \ref{fig:ERTloglossb\algfolder},
and \ref{fig:ERTgraphs\algfolder} and 
Tables~\ref{tab:ERT05D\algfolder} and \ref{tab:ERT20D\algfolder}.
The \textbf{expected running time (\ERT)}, used in the figures and table,
depends on a given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is computed
over all relevant trials as the number of function evaluations executed during
each trial while the best function value did not reach \ftarget, summed over
all trials and divided by the number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2010exp,price1997dev}.
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ using, for each trial, either the number of needed
function evaluations to reach $\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by
$-1$), or, if the target was not reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved,
measured only up to the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration if available.
%The description of figures and tables is given in \cite{}.
