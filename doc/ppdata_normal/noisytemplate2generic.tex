\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2010exp} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2010fun} are presented in 
Figures~\ref{fig:RLDs05D}, \ref{fig:RLDs20D},  
\ref{fig:scatterplots}, and \ref{fig:ERTratiographs} and
Tables~\ref{tab:ERTs05Da} to \ref{tab:ERTs20Db}.
The \textbf{expected running time (\ERT)}, used in the figures and table,
depends on a given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is computed
over all relevant trials as the number of function evaluations executed during
each trial while the best function value did not reach \ftarget, summed over
all trials and divided by the number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2010exp,price1997dev}.
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ using, for each trial, either the number of needed
function evaluations to reach $\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by
$-1$), or, if the target was not reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved,
measured only up to the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration if available.

Ratios $<10^0$ indicate an advantage of \algorithmB, smaller
values are always better. The line becomes dashed when for any algorithm the \ERT\ exceeds thrice the median
of the trial-wise overall number of $f$-evaluations for the same algorithm on this function.
Filled symbols indicate the best achieved $\Df$-value of one algorithm (\ERT\ is undefined to the right).
The dashed line continues as the fraction of successful trials of the other
algorithm, where 0 means 0\% and the y-axis limits mean 100\%, values below
zero for \algorithmB. The line ends when no algorithm reaches $\Df$ anymore. 
The number of successful trials is given, only if it was in $\{1\dots9\}$ for
\algorithmB\ (1$^{\textrm{st}}$ number) and non-zero for \algorithmA\ (2$^{\textrm{nd}}$ number).
Results are significant with $p=0.05$ for one star and $p=10^{-\#\star}$
otherwise, with Bonferroni correction within each figure.}
