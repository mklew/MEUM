%Camera-ready paper due April 13th.}}

%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2012exp} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200902_2010,hansen2012noi} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:scaling}, \ref{fig:scatterplots} and \ref{fig:RLDs} and
in Tables~\ref{tab:ERTs1to15} and~\ref{tab:ERTs16to30}. The \textbf{expected running time (ERT)}, used in the figures and table, depends on a
given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Delta\ftarget$, and is computed over all relevant trials
as the number of function evaluations executed during each trial while the best
function value did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials
and divided by the number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2012exp,price1997dev}. 
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ ($10^{-8}$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling}) using,
for each trial, either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target was not
reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to the smallest number
of overall function evaluations for any unsuccessful trial under consideration.

 (FEvals/D) to reach a target value $\fopt+\Df$ with $\Df=10^{k}$, where
 $k\in\{1, -1, -4, -8\}$ is given by the first value in the legend, for
 \algorithmA\ ($\circ$) and \algorithmB\ ($\triangledown$). Light beige lines show the ECDF of
 FEvals for target value $\Df=10^{-8}$ of all algorithms benchmarked during
 BBOB-2009. 
 Right sub-columns: ECDF of FEval ratios of \algorithmA\ divided by \algorithmB, all
 trial pairs for each function. Pairs where both trials failed are disregarded,
 pairs where one trial failed are visible in the limits being $>0$ or $<1$. The
 legends indicate the number of functions that were solved in at least one trial
 (\algorithmA\ first).

% The following two commands are all you need in the

% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{bbob}  % bbob.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file
%  and remember to run:
% latex bibtex latex latex
% to resolve all references
% to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
% the .tex source file and comment out
% the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
